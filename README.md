It is a PCB made for controlling LED Strips with [WLED](https://kno.wled.ge/). It features 4 Outputs for Adressable LED Strips, 3 Transistors to controll traditional RGB Strips and an DMX In- or Output. On the Front there are Buttons to Load Custom preset without having to open the App.

Thanks to the case it can be mounted in a standard DIN-Rail Breaker Box to have a clean-looking WLED Setup
